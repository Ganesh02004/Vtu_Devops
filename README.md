 🚀 DevSecOps Pipeline for Flask Web Application

This project demonstrates the implementation of a secure and automated **DevSecOps pipeline** for deploying a Flask-based web application. The pipeline integrates industry-standard tools to ensure continuous integration, continuous delivery, static code analysis, container security, and application deployment using Kubernetes.

---

 📌 Project Objectives

- Automate the process of building, testing, and deploying a Flask application.
- Ensure secure software delivery using DevSecOps practices.
- Scan source code and container images for vulnerabilities.
- Orchestrate deployment using Kubernetes.
- Maintain code quality and system availability with proactive monitoring.

 ⚙️ How to Run

 1. Clone the Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
````

 2. Build and Run Locally

```bash
docker build -t flask-app .
docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-app
```

 3. Run CI/CD Pipeline (via Jenkins)

* Configure a Jenkins pipeline project.
* Add GitHub webhook or poll the repo.
* Provide Docker Hub and SonarQube credentials.
* Let Jenkins automate the full pipeline.

---

 ☸️ Kubernetes Deployment

 1. Start Minikube (or your preferred cluster)

```bash
minikube start
```

 2. Deploy the App

```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/service.yaml
```

 3. Access the App

```bash
minikube service flask-service
```

---

 ✅ Pipeline Flow

1. GitHub → Jenkins → Code Checkout
2. SonarQube Static Analysis
3. Docker Image Build
4. Trivy Image Scan
5. Docker Hub Push
6. Kubernetes Deployment
7. Optional: Aqua Security for Runtime Monitoring

---

 📈 Future Enhancements

* Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for system metrics.
* Convert Kubernetes manifests to Helm charts.
* Add automated test stages to Jenkins.
* Deploy to cloud Kubernetes platforms (EKS/GKE/AKS).
